# Naoqi Pose

A partially updated version of [Naoqi's Pose Manager](https://github.com/ros-naoqi/naoqi_bridge/tree/master/naoqi_pose) 
which also requires Naoqi Node found in Naoqi Driver Py (also deprecated) to be working. 
A partially updated version of the Noaqi Node can be found [here](https://github.com/alyssarusk/naoqi-driver-py/tree/main).

Some errors have been corrected but there are still errors that need to be fixed.
